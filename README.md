This Vagrant/Ansible configuration enables you to set up a minimal Jenkins VM based on the Jenkins [SCM Sync configuration plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/SCM+Sync+configuration+plugin). The plugin stores your whole Jenkins configuration in a SCM repository (git in the example). Therefore copy your SSH keys for git repo access id_rsa and id_rsa.pub into the cloned repo directory and configure your git url in the jenkins-vm.yml. You need Vagrant installed. After a "vagrant up" in this directory (and over 10min. installation) you should be able to reach Jenkins under http://localhost:8080.
